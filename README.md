# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comprises detailed information on jobs in the data field. This dataset includes various attributes such as job titles, categories, salary information in both local currency and USD, employee residence, company location, experience level, employment type, work setting, and company size. The dataset spans multiple years and covers a wide range of positions within the data science and analytics industry worldwide.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does the average salary vary across different job categories and experience levels?
 * Is there a correlation between company size and salary ranges for data field positions?
 * Are there interesting geographical patterns in where data jobs are located versus where employees reside?
 * How does the distribution of employment types (full-time, part-time, contract) and work settings (remote, in-person, hybrid) vary across different regions and job categories?

The project will feature an array of interactive visualizations, including multiple bar charts equipped with dynamic filters and selection buttons, enabling users to navigate the data with ease and precision. For example, one visualization could offer a comparative view of average salaries across job categories, with the functionality to toggle between different experience levels at the click of a button. Another might display the distribution of jobs by employment type, allowing for deeper exploration into specific regions or job categories. To further enhance user experience and coherence across these interactive elements, a unified filter panel will be introduced. This panel will allow users to refine their view across various metrics—such as job category, experience level, and region—through a singular, streamlined action. This design approach not only enriches the navigation experience but also ensures that users can easily access and interact with the data according to their specific interests and inquiries, making the complex data landscape both accessible and engaging.


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data.

## Open Questions

While I am confident in the project's direction, I'm still exploring the best approaches to implement button functionality effectively in the visualizations and making the visualization responsive and intuitive for users with varying levels of familiarity with data analysis.

## Milestones

* Week 9: Finalize dataset preparation and initial data analysis.
* Week 10: Develop the prototype with basic interactivity and visualizations focusing on salary insights.
* Week 11-12: Expand the prototype to include other visualizations and employment type distributions.
* Week 13-14: Refine interactivity features, such as filters and toggles, to enhance user engagement and exploration.
* Week 15: Gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
* Week 16: Implement feedback, improve the visualizations and usability, and prepare the final presentation.
