# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comprises detailed information on jobs in the data field. This dataset includes various attributes such as job titles, categories, salary information in both local currency and USD, employee residence, company location, experience level, employment type, work setting, and company size. The dataset spans multiple years and covers a wide range of positions within the data science and analytics industry worldwide.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does the average salary vary across different job categories and experience levels?
 * Is there a correlation between company size and salary ranges for data field positions?
 * Are there interesting geographical patterns in where data jobs are located versus where employees reside?
 * How does the distribution of employment types (full-time, part-time, contract) and work settings (remote, in-person, hybrid) vary across different regions and job categories?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

While I am confident in the project's direction, I'm still exploring the best approaches to implement button functionality effectively in the visualizations and making the visualization responsive and intuitive for users with varying levels of familiarity with data analysis.

## Milestones

Week 1: Finalize dataset preparation and initial data analysis.
Week 2: Develop the prototype with basic interactivity and visualizations focusing on salary insights.
Week 3: Expand the prototype to include other visualizations and employment type distributions.
Week 4: Refine interactivity features, such as filters and toggles, to enhance user engagement and exploration.
Week 5: Gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
Week 6: Implement feedback, improve the visualizations and usability, and prepare the final presentation.
