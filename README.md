# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comprises detailed information on jobs in the data field. This dataset includes various attributes such as job titles, categories, salary information in both local currency and USD, employee residence, company location, experience level, employment type, work setting, and company size. The dataset spans multiple years and covers a wide range of positions within the data science and analytics industry worldwide.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does the average salary vary across different job categories and experience levels?
 * Is there a correlation between company size and salary ranges for data field positions?
 * Are there interesting geographical patterns in where data jobs are located versus where employees reside?
 * How does the distribution of employment types (full-time, part-time, contract) and work settings (remote, in-person, hybrid) vary across different regions and job categories?

## Sketches

The multiple bar charts with filters and selection buttons that allow the user to navigate through the data dynamically. For instance, one sketch might show a bar chart comparing average salaries across job categories, with buttons to toggle between different experience levels. Another sketch could visualize the count of jobs by employment type, with the ability to drill down into specific regions or job categories. Each visualization would offer interactive elements such as hover details, clickable legends, and filters to refine the view based on the user's interests, directly addressing the questions and tasks outlined above.


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data.

## Open Questions

While I am confident in the project's direction, I'm still exploring the best approaches to implement button functionality effectively in the visualizations and making the visualization responsive and intuitive for users with varying levels of familiarity with data analysis.

## Milestones

* Week 1: Finalize dataset preparation and initial data analysis.
* Week 2: Develop the prototype with basic interactivity and visualizations focusing on salary insights.
* Week 3: Expand the prototype to include other visualizations and employment type distributions.
* Week 4: Refine interactivity features, such as filters and toggles, to enhance user engagement and exploration.
* Week 5: Gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
* Week 6: Implement feedback, improve the visualizations and usability, and prepare the final presentation.
