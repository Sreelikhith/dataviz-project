# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comprises detailed information on jobs in the data field. This dataset includes various attributes such as job titles, categories, salary information in both local currency and USD, employee residence, company location, experience level, employment type, work setting, and company size. The dataset spans multiple years and covers a wide range of positions within the data science and analytics industry worldwide.


## Questions & Tasks

The project is designed to address the outlined tasks and questions effectively.

1. How Does the Average Salary Vary Across Different Job Categories and Experience Levels?
   
   Our visualization incorporates filters for job categories and experience levels. By allowing users to select specific categories and 
   experience levels, the visualization dynamically updates to display the average salary associated with the selected criteria.

   The dynamic update is likely achieved through the updateChart function, which filters the data based on user selections and recalculates the 
   average salary for the remaining dataset. The visualization then redraws the chart, specifically showing average salaries by job titles 
   within the chosen categories and experience levels. This approach enables users to explore salary variations across different job categories 
   and experience levels in an interactive manner.

2. Correlation Between Company Size and Salary Ranges?

   We have implemented a filter for company size, allowing users to explore how salary ranges vary across small, medium, and large companies. 
   This direct comparison can visually indicate if larger companies tend to offer higher salaries than smaller ones, thereby suggesting a 
   correlation between company size and salary range.

3. Geographical Patterns in Job Locations Versus Employee Residences?

   The filters for "Employee Residence" enable users to investigate geographical patterns. This mechanism allows for the exploration of where 
   jobs are located in relation to where employees live. By filtering the dataset for specific locations and comparing the distribution of job 
   locations with employee residences, users can identify trends, such as whether certain regions have a higher concentration of remote jobs or 
   if certain job categories are more prevalent in specific geographical areas.

4. Distribution of Employment Types and Work Settings Across Regions and Job Categories?

   This visualization includes filters for employment types (full-time, part-time, contract) and work settings (remote, in-person, hybrid). This 
   setup enables users to examine how these aspects vary across different regions and job categories. Selecting specific employment types or 
   work settings updates the visualization to reflect the distribution of these criteria within the chosen regions or job categories.

In my project, I will integrate a series of interactive visualizations, featuring multiple bar graphs that incorporate dynamic filters and selection buttons. These tools will allow users to explore the data accurately and efficiently. For instance, one visualization will enable a comparative analysis of average salaries across different job categories, with options to switch between various experience levels at the click of a button. Another visualization will illustrate the distribution of jobs by employment type, providing insights into specific regions or job categories. To streamline user interaction and enhance coherence across these visual elements, I will introduce a unified filter panel. This panel will facilitate the adjustment of views across several metrics such as job category, experience level, and region through a single, cohesive action. This strategic design will not only improve the user navigation experience but also ensure that the data is accessible and engaging, allowing users to tailor the information to meet their specific needs and interests.
